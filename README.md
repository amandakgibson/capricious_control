Data file: Data_for_ChangGibson2018_EvolApp
This file includes the raw data for this study. Each row gives the number of endospores attached to each of 25 nematodes included in one trial.
Each trial corresponded to soil sampled in a particular year (2013-2016) from a particular plot (A-D rotation or A-D peanut) in a particular treatment (peanut or rotation) and tested against a test host line (clonal lines 3, 6, 8, 40 or the heterogeneous Greenhouse line).
The column replicate gives unique identifiers for each plot-level test.
Columns F-AD give the results for individual nematodes.
